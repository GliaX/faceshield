# Face Shield
The goal of this project is to create a low cost, high quality, reusable face
shield that can be quickly deployed.

This face shield is currently in use in London Health Sciences Centre in the
Emergency Department.

This face shield is made by Mike Doell (@mike_doell)

# Bill of Materials
## Printed parts
* 1 head piece (headpiece.stl)
* 1 buckle (buckle.stl)

## Other hardware
* 50cm x 1cm Elastic strap
* Large: 28cm x 25cm x 0.125mm (5mil or greater) clear plastic sheet such as Mylar (facesheet-large.svg)
* Small (default): 28cm x 23cm x 0.125mm (5mil or greater) clear plastic sheet such as Mylar (facesheet-small.svg)

# Print instructions
* Use PETG or ABS
* Layer height: 0.3mm
* Use PrusaSlicer 2.2 or above to import 3MF file
* Modify filament and printer settings as needed.
* **DO NOT MODIFY PRINT SETTINGS**
* Export and print

# Mylar sheet Instructions
* Cut the mylar sheet with a laser cutter or die cutting machine if available.
* If a cutter is not available, you may manually cut the sheets to
28cm x 25cm. Consider rounding corners as per template

# Decontamination
* Disassemble head piece from strap and mylar sheet
* Soak entire shield and strap for 1 minute in warm bleach solution in well-ventilated area
* Rinse with water
* Hang to dry

# Assembly instructions
* See [Assembly Instructions illustration](instructions.jpg) for a visual guide
* Insert strap into printed head piece
* Loop strap through buckle and attach to self using heat or a dab of glue
* Insert clear plastic sheet, using strap to hold mylar in place.


# FAQs

## Mylar

Question: Can we use acetate transparency sheets instead of mylar?

Answered by kliment: Cellulose acetate (transparency sheets) are hydrophilic and retain water and water droplets for a long time, whereas PET (mylar) does not. Based on this I would recommend against acetate unless you have no choice. If you do use acetate, note it may not survive disinfection as many solvents attack it.  Heat resistant (meant for laser printers) transparencies are made of Mylar.


Question: How thick is 0.125mm?

Answer: 0.125mm is .00492 inches, or 5 mil.


## Printing materials

Question: What 3D printing materials can be used, that would be compatible with the decontamination procedure?

Answered by tareko: We recommend only PETG and ABS.


## Health Standards

Question: Are any standards (by Health Canada or other certifications) that these shields need to meet before they are used?

Answered by tareko: This is a Class I device, so Health Canada's standards apply to the manufacturing facility and distributing company rather than to each individual device. Glia's stuff is all produced in a Health-Canada licensed facility (we hold an MDEL from them), and of course we follow all the protocols.


Question: If another facility would like touse your designs and follow the same protocols you provide, then what exactly are the Health-Canada implications?

Answered by tareko: If you want to have your own Health Canada certification, take a look at https://cloud.emlondon.ca/s/apcPnMiTb9bLCW8 from HC. TL;DR: It's a 24 hour turn around now.
If you don't want to do that, what we would do is take the 3D prints from you and 'produce' the end device in London (Ontario), then send it back out. Inefficient, yes, but Health Canada compliant.
