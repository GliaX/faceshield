# Face Shield
The goal of this project is to create a low cost, high quality, reusable face
shield that can be quickly deployed.

This face shield is currently in use in London Health Sciences Centre in the
Emergency Department.

This face shield is based on [this original design with minor modifications](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4222407)

# Bill of Materials
## Printed parts
* 1 head piece (headpiece.stl)
* 1 buckle (buckle.stl)

## Other hardware
* Elastic strap (70cm)
* 28cm x 25cm x 0.125mm clear plastic sheet such as Mylar (facesheet.svg)

# Print instructions
* Use PETG or ABS
* Layer height: 0.3mm
* Use PrusaSlicer 2.2 or above to import 3MF file
* Modify filament and printer settings as needed.
* **DO NOT MODIFY PRINT SETTINGS**
* Export and print

# Mylar sheet Instructions
* Cut the mylar sheet with a laser cutter if available.
* If laser cutter is not available, you may manually cut the sheets to
28cm x 25cm. Consider rounding corners as per template

# Mylar Sheet Substitute
* 1.5 Litre Smart water bottle (found in Walmart) may be used. When the bottle is cut down the middle the dimensions are perfect. A new stl file will need to be created to keep the bottom from twisting inwards but in a pinch it works without it. Remove glue left over from sticker with any type of cooking oil or rubbing alcohol.

# Sterilization
* Disassemble head piece from strap and mylar sheet
* Soak entire shield and strap for 1 minute in warm bleach solution in well-ventilated area
* Rinse with water

# Assembly instructions
* Insert strap into printed head piece
* Loop strap through buckle and attack to self using heat or a dab of glue
* Insert clear plastic sheet, using strap to hold mylar in place.
