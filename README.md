# Face Shield
The goal of this project is to create a low cost, high quality, reusable face
shield that can be quickly deployed.

This face shield is currently in use in the Gaza Strip.

This face shield's 3D printed design was made by Jake Bender. Contributors include Mike Doell (@mike_doell)
and Mosaic Manufacturing. The injection-molded design was made by Abd Aliwa and Steve Plimmer.
